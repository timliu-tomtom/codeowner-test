/**
 * Defines the parameters of a Search Along the Route query.
 *
 * @param query The search query.
 * @param route The route points.
 * @param maxDetourTime The maximum detour time. The maximum value is 3600 seconds.
 * @param typeAhead If this flag is set to true, the query will be interpreted
 * as a partial input and the search will enter predictive mode.
 * @param limit The maximum number of search results that will be returned.
 * @param categorySet Restricts the Points Of Interest in the response to those whose category ID is listed.
 * @param brandSet A list of brand names used to restrict the result to POIs associated
 * with those brands.
 * @param connectorSet A list of connector types used to restrict the results to
 * electric vehicle stations that support those connector types.
 * See https://developer.tomtom.com/search-api/search-api-documentation/supported-connector-types
 * for more details.
 * @param minPowerKw A double value representing a power rate in kilowatts, used to restrict
 * the results to electric vehicle stations with at least one connector with that minimum power.
 * @param maxPowerKw A double value representing a power rate in kilowatts, used
 * the results to electric vehicle stations with at least one connector with that maximum power.
 * @param fuelSet A set of [FuelType]s, used to restrict the results to ones with specific fuels.
 * @param geopoliticalView Defines what kind of geopolitical view should be used.
 * @param detourOffset Parameter which turns on calculation of the distance between the start
 * of the route and the starting point of the detour to a POI.
 * @param sortBy Defines how the results will be sorted.
 * @param openingHours Scope of the opening hours to be provided.
 * @param spreadingMode Defines the spreading of returned results along the route.
 * @param mapCodes The set of [MapCodeType]s which will be supported.
 * @param timeZone Used to indicate the mode in which the time zone object will be returned.
 * @param relatedPois Uses the [RequestedPoiRelationType] to specify what kinds of related POIs to return.
 * Points Of Interest.
 *
 * Important: This is a Public Preview API. It may be changed or removed at any time.
