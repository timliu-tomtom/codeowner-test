/**
 * Defines the parameters of a Fuzzy Search.
 *
 * @param query The searched query.
 * @param typeAhead If this flag is set to true, the query will be interpreted
 * as a partial input and the search will enter predictive mode.
 * @param limit The maximum number of search results that will be returned. Default limit is 10.
 * @param offset The starting offset of the returned results within the full result set.
 * @param countrySet A set of ISO 3166-1 alpha3 country codes. (e.g., FRA, ESP).
 * This will limit the search to the specified countries.
 * ISO 3166-1 alpha2 country codes (e.g., FR, ES) are also supported,
 * but only for the online search mode.
 * @param position The [GeoCoordinate] position where results should be biased.
 * @param radius The radius parameter is specified in meters.
 * The results will be constrained to the defined area.
 * @param boundingBox The [GeoBoundingBox] for the search.
 * @param language The language in which search results should be returned.
 * Should be one of the supported IETF language tags.
 * See https://developer.tomtom.com/search-api/search-api/supported-languages for more details.
 * @param extendedPostalCodes Indexes for which extended postal codes should be included
 * in the results.
 * @param minFuzzyLevel The minimum fuzziness level to be used.
 * The default value is 1. The maximum value is 4.
 * @param maxFuzzyLevel The maximum fuzziness level to be used.
 * The default value is 2. The maximum value is 4.
 * @param idx A set of [IndexType] which should be utilized for the search.
 * @param categorySet Restricts the Points Of Interest in the response to those whose ID is listed.
 * @param brandSet A list of brand names which could be used to restrict the result
 * to specific brands.
 * @param connectorSet A list of connector types which could be used to restrict the result
 * to Points Of Interest of type Electric Vehicle Station, supporting specific connector types.
 * See https://developer.tomtom.com/search-api/search-api-documentation/supported-connector-types
 * for more details.
 * @param minPowerKW A double value representing the power rate in kilowatts which is used
 * to restrict the result to the Points Of Interest of type Electric Vehicle Station supporting
 * at least one connector with a specific minimal value of power in kilowatts.
 * @param maxPowerKW A double value representing the power rate in kilowatts which is used
 * to restrict the result to the Points Of Interest of type Electric Vehicle Station supporting
 * at least one connector with a specific maximum value of power in kilowatts.
 * @param fuelSet A set of a [FuelType] which will be used to restrict the result to
 * the Points Of Interest of specific fuels.
 * @param geopoliticalView Defines what kind of geopolitical view should be used.
 * @param openingHours The opening hours scope.
 * @param timeZone Used to indicate the mode in which the time zone object should be returned.
 * @param mapCodes The set of [MapCodeType] which will be supported.
 * @param relatedPois A [RequestedPoiRelationType] that provides the possibility to return related
 * Points Of Interest.
 * @param entityTypeSet A set of [EntityType] which will be used to restrict the result to
 * the Geography result of a specific entity type.
 * @param category Determines whether the Category Search is enabled.
 *
 * Important: This is a Public Preview API. It may be changed or removed at any time.
