/**
 * Describes an entity found within the autocomplete search term. An entity is a distinct part
 * of the search term that can be used to generate a query.
 *
 * @param type The type of entity detected.
 * @param value The value of the entity. It may be a category name, brand name, or a piece
 * of unrecognized text. If it's a brand segment, the content of this field can be used
 * to restrict results of other search endpoints to Points Of Interest (POI) for specific brands.
 * See the brandSet parameter in the Fuzzy Search service
 * [documentation][https://developer.tomtom.com/search-api/search-api-documentation-search/fuzzy-search].
 * @param matches Reports which part of the input query contains the matched segment. Input query
 * matching may not be continuous, so the mapping is defined by an array of matched substrings.
 * @param id Category segment type. Can be used to restrict the results of other
 * search endpoints to Points Of Interest (POI) from specific categories. See the categorySet
 * parameter in the Fuzzy Search service
 * [documentation][https://developer.tomtom.com/search-api/search-api-documentation-search/fuzzy-search].
 * @param matchedAlternativeName (Optional) category segment type. Present only if
 * a part of the user query matches an alternative name instead of a primary name. For example,
 * for the input query "petrol station" the category segment value is "gas station" and the
 * matchedAlternativeName is "petrol station".
 *
 * @see [Fuzzy Search Service][https://developer.tomtom.com/search-api/search-api-documentation-search/fuzzy-search]
