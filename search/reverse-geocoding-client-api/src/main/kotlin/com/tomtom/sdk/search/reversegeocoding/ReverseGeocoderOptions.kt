/**
 * Defines the parameters of a Reverse Geocoding query.
 *
 * @param position Coordinate that will be translated into a human-understandable
 * street address, street element, or geography.
 * @param heading The directional heading of the vehicle in degrees when it is traveling
 * along a segment of roadway. Zero is North, 90 is East and so on.
 * @param radiusInMeters The maximum distance in meters from the specified position
 * that the reverseGeocode will deliver results for.
 * @param roadUses Restricts reverse geocoding to certain types of road uses.
 * @param entityTypes This parameter specifies the level of filtering performed on geographies.
 * Providing this parameter narrows the search to specified geography entity types.
 * The resulting response will contain the geography ID as well as the matched entity type.
 * This ID is a token that can be used to get the geometry of that geography.
 * The following parameters are ignored when entityType is set: [heading], [roadUses]
 * @param language IETF language tag (case insensitive), for the language in which search results
 * should be returned. When the language tag is invalid or data in a specified language is not
 * available for a specific field, the default value is used.
 * The default language value is NGT (Neutral Ground Truth), that means official languages for all
 * regions in local scripts if available.
 * @param geoPoliticalView An ISO 3166-1 alpha3 country code, that gives the context used to resolve
 * the handling of disputed territories. If there are no geopolitical views for the provided country
 * code then the default view is used.
 * @param mapCodeTypes Enables the return of map codes. Can also filter the response to only show
 * selected [MapCodeType]s.
 * @param preferClosestAccurateAddress Gives the preference to the closest accurate address
 * over the address with the closest navigable coordinates.
 * @param fetchGeometry Enables the return of geometry shapes for the provided reverse geocoding
 * results. (where available)
 * The geometry fetching feature isn't implemented yet (this option was added for the future
 * extension).
 *
 * Important: This is a Public Preview API. It may be changed or removed at any time.
